            Retaining walls can be a beautiful feature of any landscape while
            serving the critical function of preventing soil erosion and
            managing grade changes. Whether for residential landscaping or
            commercial development, properly engineered retaining walls combine
            aesthetic appeal with structural integrity.

            Jones & DeMille Engineering brings extensive experience in retaining
            wall design, understanding both the engineering requirements and the
            importance of visual integration with your property. Our engineers
            consider soil conditions, drainage, load requirements, and local
            building codes to design retaining walls that are both safe and
            attractive.

          <p>
            The International Building Code establishes specific requirements
            for retaining walls based on height, load, and other factors. Jones
            & DeMille Engineering (J&DE) has experience across our Utah offices
            in Richfield, Price, Manti, and Roosevelt, working with local
            jurisdictions throughout the state to ensure compliance with all
            applicable codes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our engineers are well-versed in the technical requirements for
            retaining walls, including proper foundation design, adequate
            drainage systems, appropriate materials selection, and structural
            calculations. We ensure every retaining wall design meets or exceeds
            all safety standards and building code requirements.

        <ContentSection title="What Type of Retaining Wall Do I Need?">
          <p>
            There are four main types of retaining walls, each suited to
            different applications:
          </p>
          <div class="space-y-6 mt-6">
            <div>
              <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Gravity Wall</h4>
              <p>
                The standard type of retaining wall that holds dirt and soil by
                its own weight. These walls rely on their mass to resist the
                pressure from the soil behind them. Gravity walls are commonly
                built from stone, concrete, or masonry units.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Piling Wall</h4>
              <p>
                Made of wood, reinforced concrete, or steel piles driven into
                the ground. These walls are ideal for situations where
                excavation is limited or soil conditions are challenging. The
                piles transfer lateral forces deep into stable soil layers.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">
                Cantilever Wall
              </h4>
              <p>
                An engineering marvel that uses the weight of the soil behind it
                and a foundation slab to resist overturning. Cantilever walls
                are reinforced concrete structures with a stem and base slab
                designed to work together as a system, providing efficient
                resistance to soil pressure.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Anchored Wall</h4>
              <p>
                Anchored to the earth behind the wall using cables or rods
                extending back into the soil mass. Anchors are installed at an
                angle and grouted into place, providing exceptional resistance
                to overturning. This type is often used for very tall walls or
                where space is limited.
              </p>

            Our engineers will evaluate your specific site conditions, height
            requirements, soil characteristics, and aesthetic preferences to
            recommend the most appropriate retaining wall type for your project.
          </p>
        </ContentSection>

        <ContentSection title="Foundation First" backgroundColor="bg-gray-50">
          <p>
            The foundation is the most critical component of any retaining wall
            system. Proper foundation design ensures long-term performance and
            prevents costly failures. Jones & DeMille engineers carefully
            evaluate soil bearing capacity, frost depth, and drainage
            requirements to design appropriate foundations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Foundation types for retaining walls vary based on wall design and
            site conditions. Options include concrete footings, block
            foundations, reinforced concrete slabs, timber foundations, and
            segmental wall base courses. The choice depends on the wall type,
            height, soil conditions, and expected loads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proper foundation preparation, including excavation, compaction, and
            drainage installation, is essential for retaining wall success. Our
            engineers provide detailed foundation specifications ensuring your
            retaining wall performs as intended for decades.
          </p>
        </ContentSection>

        <ContentSection title="Have an Existing Retaining Wall that Needs Repair?">
          <p>
            Jones & DeMille engineers can assess damage to existing retaining
            walls and provide solutions to restore structural integrity. Whether
            your wall is showing signs of tilting, cracking, bulging, or
            drainage problems, we can evaluate the cause and recommend
            appropriate repairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our evaluation process includes visual inspection, measurement of
            movement or deflection, assessment of drainage conditions, soil
            evaluation, and review of original design (if available). Based on
            this assessment, we can provide repair recommendations ranging from
            minor drainage improvements to complete wall reconstruction if
            necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            J&DE engineers ensure that retaining walls are not only structurally
            sound but also aesthetically pleasing additions to your property. We
            understand that retaining walls are visible features of your
            landscape and can significantly impact property value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our design approach considers materials, colors, textures, and
            finishing options that complement your existing architecture and
            landscaping. Whether you prefer the natural look of stone, the clean
            lines of concrete, or the warmth of timber, we can design a
            retaining wall that enhances your property's visual appeal while
            providing essential structural support.
