            Water Storage Tanks are a Community Investment
          </h3>
          <p>
            Water storage tanks are specialized engineered structures that
            require expert design and construction management. Jones & DeMille
            (J&DE) engineers and designers bring extensive experience in
            overcoming geographical challenges and providing comprehensive
            construction management for water storage projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our structural engineers and designers use the highest quality
            standards and state-of-the-art technology to ensure your water
            storage system performs reliably for decades. We understand that
            water infrastructure is a critical community investment, and we
            approach every project with the attention and expertise it deserves.

          <p>
            J&DE structural engineers work directly with city managers and
            communities to evaluate water system needs and plan for future
            growth. Our comprehensive evaluation process includes:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>Current pipe network system assessment</li>
            <li>Current pressure zones and potential system risks analysis</li>
            <li>
              Evaluation of whether water pressure is currently too low or too
              high
            </li>
            <li>Community growth projections within specified timeframes</li>
            <li>Review of past repairs and maintenance history</li>
            <li>
              Assessment of whether current water storage tanks can be upgraded
              or need replacement
            </li>
            <li>Current delivery systems evaluation</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4">
            This thorough analysis ensures your water storage tank project
            addresses both current needs and future demands, maximizing your
            infrastructure investment.
