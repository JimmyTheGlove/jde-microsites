const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Why are foundation certifications important?",
    answer:
      "Foundation certifications are important because manufactured homes and modular homes require that the home and foundation be inspected by a professional, state-licensed engineer before a lender will approve a refinance or new loan. This ensures the foundation meets HUD standards and protects your investment.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are some of the requirements for an FHA/HUD manufactured home foundation certification?",

      "FHA/HUD manufactured home foundation certifications must comply with the HUD Permanent Foundation Guide for Manufactured Homes. The engineer verifies that the foundation meets all structural requirements, proper anchoring, and code compliance for the specific home type.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does a virtual site visit work?",
    answer:
      "Virtual site visits are conducted using video conferencing or direct meeting platforms. Our inspectors guide you through the property remotely, allowing you to show the foundation and key structural elements while maintaining safety and convenience. This innovative approach saves time while ensuring thorough inspection.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How much does a manufactured home engineer foundation certification cost?",
    answer:
      "Costs vary based on property location, complexity, and specific requirements. We offer competitive pricing and typically complete certifications within 5 days. Contact us for a detailed quote tailored to your specific situation.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How long does it take to have an engineer foundation certification?",
    answer:
      "Our typical turnaround time is 5 days from the virtual site visit to delivery of the completed certification letter. We understand the importance of timely completion for refinancing and sale transactions.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What happens if the inspection finds the foundation is not HUD compliant?",
    answer:
      "If the foundation is found to be non-compliant, we provide a detailed report outlining the specific issues and recommendations for bringing it into compliance. This allows you to make informed decisions about repairs needed before proceeding with your transaction.",

          Budget-friendly homeownership is important to all of us. When buying
          or refinancing a manufactured home, both homeowners and lenders want
          to ensure the foundation meets HUD standards. Foundation
          certifications protect your investment and ensure compliance with
          federal requirements, giving you peace of mind while keeping costs
          manageable.

          Your family's safety and your home's value are our top priorities.
          Foundation certifications ensure your manufactured home meets all
          safety and code compliance standards set by HUD. A properly certified
          foundation isn't just a requirement for financing—it's an investment
          in your home's structural integrity and your family's well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problem foundations can lead to costly repairs and decreased property
          value. Our thorough inspection process identifies any issues early,
          allowing you to address them before they become major concerns.
          Whether you're refinancing or selling, a certified foundation gives
          buyers and lenders confidence in your home's quality and safety.
